## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Radix Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/) - Unstyled, accessible components for building highâ€‘quality web apps in Vue.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

In this project, I got to know and learned how to use the Radix Vue library, which is similar to Radix UI in React.js, and it helped me a lot in creating the keyboard-accessible and navigable accordion.

### Useful resources

- [Vue Style Guide](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/) - This helped me with its rules. I really liked the patterns and will use it going forward on my Vue projects.
- [Radix Vue](https://www.radix-vue.com/) - This is an amazing component library which helped me create accessible components. I'd recommend it to anyone still use this library.
